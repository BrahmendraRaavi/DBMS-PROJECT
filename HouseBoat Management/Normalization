It is used to make the tables into smaller relations by breaking the bad relations. To reduce the redundancy and minimize the insertion,deletion and update anomalies.Normal frame is a framework for analyzing relation schemas based on their keys and the FDs among their Attributes. 
In the taken houseboating data base in the relational scheme there are violations of normal form.There are violations in the tables Tourist,Driver,Boat,Owner.
8.2 Normalization for Tourist table: 
In the Toursit table the FD’s and the violations of the normal forms. 
TOURIST(T_ID,T_FIRSTNAME,T_LASTNAME,T_AGE,T_PHONE,T_LOCATION) As it violates the 1NF as it has the multivalued attributes for the name section . 
We change them into the T_name 
 
FD’s are : FD1: {T_ID} → {T_name,T_T_AGE,T_phone,T_location) 
FD2: {T_phone} → {T_Location} 
The taken FD’s violates the 3 NF as where it has transitive relation in the FD2 we should remove it After the 3NF: 
Tourist 1 :(T_ID,T_NAME,T_AGE,T_PHONE) 
Tourist 2:(T_Phone,T_location) 
8.3 Normalization for Driver table: 
in the Driver table the FD’s and the violations of the normal forms 
Driver(D_ID,D_SSN,D_FIRSTNAME,D_LASTNAME,D_SALARY,D_AGE,D_PHONE,D_LOCAT ON) 
As it violates the 1NF as it has the multivalued attributes for the name section We change them into the D_name after the first normal form 
FD’s are : FD1: {D_ID,D_SSN} → {D_name,D_salary,D_age,D_phone,D_location) FD 2: {D_ID} → {D_name} 
FD 3 :{D_SSN} → {D_salary} 
FD 4: {D_phone} → {D_Location} 
The taken Fd’s violates the 2 Nf from FD2 and FD3 as it has the partial dependence After the 2NF 
(D_ID,D_SSN,D_AGE,D_PHONE,D_LOCATION) 
(D_ID,D_name) 
(D_SSN, D_salary)
The taken FD’s violates the 3 NF as where it has transitive relation in the FD2 we should remove it 
After the 3NF: 
Driver 1 :(D_ID,D_SSN,D_AGE,D_PHONE) 
Driver 2 : (D_ID, D_name) 
 
Driver 3: (D_SSN , D_salary) 
Driver 4:(D_Phone,D_location) 
8.4 Normalization for Boat Table: 
In the Boat table the FD’s and the violations of the normal forms 
Boat(H_ID,O_id ,H_name,Capacity,Type ,Noofbeds,price ) 
As it violates the 1NF as it has the multivalued attributes for the ac,non/ac section We change them into the Type after the first normal form 
FD’s are : FD1: {H_ID, O_id} → {Capacity,Type ,Noofbeds ) 
FD 2: {H_ID} → {H_name} 
FD 3 :{TYPE} → {price} 
The taken Fd’s violates the 2 Nf from FD2 as it has the partial dependence After the 2NF 
(H_ID,O_id ,Type ,Noofbeds,price,capacity) 
(H_ID,H_name) 
The taken FD’s violates the 3 NF as where it has transitive relation in the FD2 we should remove it 
After the 3NF: 
Boat :(H_ID,O_id,Capacity,Type,No.of.beds) 
Boat 1 : (H_ID,H_name) 
Boat 2: (TYPE ,Price)
8.5 Normalization for Owner table: 
In the Owner table the FD’s and the violations of the normal forms 
Owner(O_ID,O_FIRSTNAME,O_LASTNAME,O_PHONE,TC_id) 
As it violates the 1NF as it has the multivalued attributes of the first name,lastname section 
We change them into the O_name after the first normal form 
 
FD’s are : FD1: {O_ID} → {O_name,O_phone,TC_id) 
FD 2: {O_name} → {TC_id} 
The taken FD’s violates the 3 NF as where it has transitive relation in the FD2 we should remove it 
After the 3NF: 
Owner 1 :(O_ID,O_name,D_PHONE) 
Owner 2 : (O_name, TC_id) 
8.6 Final Tables after Normalization are 
● Owner 1 
● Owner 2 
● Boat 
● Boat 1 
● Boat 2 
● Driver 1 
● Driver 2 
● Driver 3 
● Driver 4 
● Tourist 1 
● Tourist 2
